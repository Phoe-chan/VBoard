VBoard
======

Node.js based website using websockets for realtime updating of a virtual boardgame surface.

Development branch to implement support for multiple boards on the site. Actors will be specific to the board they are added to and cannot transfer between boards. Each board will be assigned a background image generated by the server admin for the timebeing until I think of a good way to handle the security issues with allowing file upload.

Running
=======

Just run node app.js and then connect multiple webbrowsers to port 3000. You can drag actors around in the scene, create new actors using the New Actor Name and "+" button, or destroy actors by dropping them into the Destroy box on the top right.

The board implements no gamelogic as it is to support our Play By Skype sessions of tabletop roleplaying games, it is simply a visualisation tool to help in the more tactically based games we play.

Updates
=======
v1.1 - Added stance functionality. Actors can now be in one of four stances, Forward, Balanced, Defensive and Ranged, the stance can be changed by clicking on the desired stance in the stance bar on each actor. The currently selected stance is backlit in white.
